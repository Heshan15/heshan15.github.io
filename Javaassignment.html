  Harry Potter meets Dobby, a house-elf who warns him that it is dangerous to return to Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione rescue him in their father's flying car. In Diagon Alley, Harry sees Draco Malfoy's father slip a book into Ginny Weasley's cauldron. Harry, Ron, and Hermione plan to question Malfoy, using a polyjuice potion brew in a bathroom haunted by Moaning Myrtle. When Harry communicates with a snake, the school believes he is the heir, but Harry and Ron learn that a Muggle-born girl died when the Chamber was last opened.

Harry and Ron find an enchanted diary owned by Tom Riddle, who blames Rubeus Hagrid for the Chamber's opening. When the diary is stolen and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. Hagrid's giant pet spider, Aragog, reveals Hagrid's innocence. The school staff learns that Ginny has been taken into the Chamber and nominate Lockhart to save her. Harry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious, guarded by Riddle.

Riddle uses the diary to manipulate Ginny into reopening the Chamber. Harry stabs the diary with the basilisk fang, destroying Riddle and reviving Ginny. Fawkes' tears heal Harry, who returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart. The basilisk's victims are healed, Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron, and Hagrid is released from Azkaban.

      <p>The Weasleys invite Harry Potter to attend the Quidditch World Cup final. The match ends in a victory for the Irish, but the campsite is attacked by Voldemort's followers. Hogwarts reopens and a new tournament is announced between three schools to compete for the Triwizard Cup.

Harry and Cedric find a partner, Parvati and Padma Patil, but Ron gets jealous of Hermione Granger with Viktor Krum.</p>
      <p>The Quidditch field is prepared for the Third Task, which requires champions to overcome a maze filled with obstacles. Harry and Cedric succeed in reaching the centre, but are transported outside Hogwarts to a graveyard. Harry is alerted when his scar starts burning wildly, and Wormtail kills Cedric with his wand. Voldemort summons his Death Eaters and tries to kill Harry, but fails when his and Harry's wandstreams connect in Priori Incantatem. Dumbledore, McGonagall and Snape force Moody to reveal himself to be Barty Crouch Jr, a Death Eater formerly presumed dead.</p>
      <p>Harry wins the Tournament and is transported to the graveyard for Voldemort's ritual. Harry recovers in the hospital wing and returns to live with the Dursleys for the summer.</p>

		Harry Potter and Dudley are attacked by Dementors and Harry repels them using a Patronus spell. The Ministry of Magic expels him from Hogwarts, but he is later exonerated. The Order of the Phoenix informs Harry that Lord Voldemort is seeking an object he previously lacked. Dolores Umbridge is appointed as Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor and Harry is forced to write lines for "lying" about Voldemort.

Umbridge catches them and Hermione claims Dumbledore has hidden a "secret weapon" in the Forbidden Forest. Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville and Ginny fly to the Ministry of Magic on Thestrals to save Sirius. They enter the Department of Mysteries and recover a bottled prophecy labelled with Harry's name. Death Eaters, including Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange, ambush them and force Harry to surrender the prophecy.
