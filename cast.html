</div>
<p>According to Rowling, the idea for both the Harry Potter books and its eponymous character came while waiting for a delayed train from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_England" title="Manchester, England">Manchester, England</a> to London in 1990. She stated that the idea of "this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who didn't know he was a wizard became more and more real to me".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)#cite_note-jkrbio-2">[2]</a> While developing the ideas for her book, she also decided to make Harry an orphan who attended a boarding school called Hogwarts. She explained in a 1999 interview with <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></em>: "Harry had to be an orphan—so that he's a free agent, with no fear of letting down his parents, disappointing them ... Hogwarts has to be a boarding school—half the important stuff happens at night! Then there's the security. Having a child of my own reinforces my belief that children above all want security, and that's what Hogwarts offers Harry."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)#cite_note-carey1999-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Her own mother's death on 30 December 1990 inspired Rowling to write Harry as a boy longing for his dead parents, his anguish becoming "much deeper, much more real" than in earlier drafts because she related to it herself.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)#cite_note-jkrbio-2">[2]</a> In a 2000 interview with <em>The Guardian</em>, Rowling also established that the character of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur" title="King Arthur">Wart</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._H._White" title="T. H. White">T. H. White</a>'s novel <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Once_and_Future_King" title="The Once and Future King">The Once and Future King</a></em> is "Harry's spiritual ancestor".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)#cite_note-Guardian2000-4">[4]</a> Finally, she established Harry's birth date as 31 July, the same as her own. However, she maintained that Harry was not directly based on any real-life person: "he came just out of a part of me".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)#cite_note-Raincoast2001-5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Rowling has also maintained that Harry is a suitable real-life role model for children. "The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom you would never meet ... if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)#cite_note-BN1999-6">[6]</a></p>

        <p>Hermione is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-4">[4]</a> who becomes best friends with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Weasley" title="Ron Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>. Rowling states that she was born on 19 September 1979<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-rowlinghermione-2">[2]</a> and she was nearly twelve when she first attended Hogwarts.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-age-5">[5]</a> She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by Rowling as a "very logical, upright and good" character.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-EBF_2004-6">[6]</a> Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">Muggle</a> dentists, are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but "quite proud of her all the same".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-EBF_2004-6">[6]</a> They are well aware of the wizard world and have visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagon_Alley" title="Diagon Alley">Diagon Alley</a> with her.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-7">[7]</a> Hermione is an only child.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-EBF_2004-6">[6]</a> But Rowling revealed in a 2004 interview that Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned sibling did not appear since she felt it "might be too late now" to introduce the character.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-WBD2004-8">[8]</a> Rowling has called the character of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a> the "anti-Hermione" as they are so very different.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-9">[9]</a></p>
        <p>Rowling said the character of Hermione has several autobiographic influences: "I did not set out to make Hermione like me but she is a bit like me. She is an exaggeration of how I was when I was younger."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-EBF_2004-6">[6]</a> She recalled being called a "little know-it-all" in her youth.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-rowlinghermione-2">[2]</a> And she says that not unlike herself, "there is a lot of insecurity and a great fear of failure" beneath Hermione's swottiness. Finally, according to Rowling, next to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, Hermione is the perfect expository character; because of her encyclopedic knowledge, she can always be used as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_dump" title="Plot dump">plot dump</a> to explain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_universe" title="Harry Potter universe"><em>Harry Potter</em> universe</a>.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-kloves-10">[10]</a> Rowling also states that her feminist conscience is rescued by Hermione, "who's the brightest witch of her age" and a "very strong female character."<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-O-11">[11]</a></p>
        <p>Hermione's first name is taken from a character in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winter%27s_Tale" title="The Winter's Tale">The Winter's Tale</a></em>, though Rowling has said that the two characters have little to nothing in common.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-TNPC1999-12">[12]</a> Rowling said that she wanted her name to be unusual since if fewer girls had the name, fewer girls would get teased for it and it seemed the sort of name that "a pair of professional dentists, who liked to prove how clever they were" would give their daughter.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-TNPC1999-12">[12]</a> Her original surname was "Puckle", but Rowling felt the name "did not suit her at all", and so the less frivolous Granger was used.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger#cite_note-rowlinghermione-2">[2]</a></p>

      <h5>Albus Dumbaledore (Michael John Gambon)</h5>
Prof. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore[1] is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. For most of the series, he is the headmaster of the wizarding school Hogwarts. As part of his backstory, it is revealed that he is the founder and leader of the Order of the Phoenix, an organisation dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort, the main antagonist of the series. Dumbledore was portrayed by Richard Harris in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002). Following Harris' death in October 2002, Michael Gambon portrayed Dumbledore in the six remaining Harry Potter films from 2004 to 2011. Jude Law portrayed Dumbledore as a middle-aged man in the prequel films Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018) and Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore (2022).[2] Rowling stated she chose the name Dumbledore, which is a dialectal word for "bumblebee",[3] because of Dumbledore's love of music: she imagined him walking around "humming to himself a lot" .<br>

    <h5>Lord Voldemort (Tom Marvolo Riddle)</h5>
    Lord Voldemort (/ˈvoʊldəmɔːr/ VOHL-də-mor, /-mɔːrt/ -⁠mort in the films)[a] is a sobriquet for Tom Marvolo Riddle, a character and the main antagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of Harry Potter novels. The character first appeared in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which was published in 1997, and returned either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series except the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, in which he is only mentioned. Voldemort is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has "the power to vanquish the Dark Lord". He attempts to murder the boy, but instead kills his parents, Lily and James Potter, and leaves Harry with a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt. Nearly every witch or wizard dares not utter his name and refers to him instead with such monikers as "You-Know-Who", "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", or "the Dark Lord". Voldemort's obsession with blood purity signifies his aim to rid the wizarding world of Muggle (non-magical) heritage and to conquer both worlds, Muggle and wizarding, to achieve pure-blood dominance. Through his mother's family, he is the last descendant of the wizard Salazar Slytherin,[6][7] one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He is the leader of the Death Eaters, a group of evil wizards and witches dedicated to ridding the Wizarding World of Muggles and establishing Voldemort as its supreme ruler.</div>

	<div class="col-lg-6"><h5><strong>Weasley Family</strong></h5>Weasley was the surname of a pure-blood wizarding family in Great Britain. They were considered one of the prominent wizarding families, although their lack of money and their sympathy for Muggle-born wizards and even Muggles made other wizards and witches view them scornfully. They lived in The Burrow, a ramshackle house of four or five stories "a little way outside" the village of Ottery St Catchpole.

They were included in the Sacred Twenty-Eight list, published in the Pure-Blood Directory by the 1930s. However, they deplored their inclusion in the list, because they said they had ancestral ties to many interesting Muggles. Their protests earned these families the opprobrium of advocates of the pure-blood doctrine, and the epithet 'blood traitor'.[4]

When Harry Potter befriended Arthur and Molly Weasley's youngest son, Ronald Weasley, the Weasleys became a second family to Harry. The Burrow became Harry's home away from home and Arthur and Molly served as de facto godparents in Sirius Black's absence. Harry would eventually marry into the family when he married Ginevra Weasley.</div>
